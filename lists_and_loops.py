python Lists and Loops
======================

Directions
----------

Create a document named lists_and_loops.py and save it in your z:\CSP folder.

1) - Use the range() command to create a list named myNumbers, containing numbers
        between 1 and 50
   - Loop through the list and print each number.

2) Create a list named myGrades using the following values:
        88, 91, 57, 36, 93, 83, 74, 32

3) Use a for loop to sum the values in myGrades.

4) Use a for loop to print the highest value from the myGrades list.

5) Use a while loop to print the average value from the myGrades list.

5) Create a list named studentNames using the following names:
        "Pete", "Joseph", "Stephen", "Wyatt", "Drew", "elijah"

6) Use a while loop to print the name from the studentNames list with the
        most characters.

7) Use the in operator to determine if the name "Drew" is in the studentNames list.
        Print "Drew is in the list" if his name is in the studentNames list.

8) Create a 2d list named armorList. The first column must be the armor name,
    The second column must contain attack speed and the third column must contain
    damage.

9) Use a nested for loop to print the armorList.
